# Getting Started

To see our app you can first clone this repo and follow these steps :

1. `npm i`
1. `npm start`
1. Open [http://localhost:3000], to view it in the browser.

# Work Flow

We have planned first to create a dummy data at React to see how the app will look like, after that we will use the fetch method to get the response from two API's, which are one for the news and the second for the Translation, after that, it would be displayed it in the screen according to the user request.

For the endpoint, its gonna be one which is by default "/" home endpoint.

**we will update this part after we finish the app.**
